# Welcome to your Jupyter Book

EC-KitY is a Python tool kit for doing evolutionary computation, and it is scikit-learn compatible.

Currently we have implemented Genetic Algorithm (GA) and tree-based Genetic Programming (GP), but EC-KitY will grow!

EC-KitY is:

- A comprehensive toolkit for running evolutionary algorithms
Written in Python
- Can work with or without scikit-learn, i.e., supports both sklearn and non-sklearn modes
- Designed with modern software engineering in mind
- Designed to support all popular EC paradigms (GA, GP, ES, coevolution, multi-objective, etc').
