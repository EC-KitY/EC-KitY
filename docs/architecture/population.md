# Population

Population evolved through the experiment. It consists of one or more Subpopulations.

# Subpopulation

This class represents a collection of individuals.
Each Subpopulation defines its own individual representation and fitness evaluation function.

We usually refer to the simple case, where only one subpopulation exists in the entire evolutionary algorithm.
However, multiple Subpopulation objects should be used for Coevolution, Island models etc.
