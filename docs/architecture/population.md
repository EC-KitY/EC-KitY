# Population

The Population class represents the population. It consists of one or more Subpopulations.

# Subpopulation

This class represents a collection of individuals.
Each Subpopulation defines its own individual representation and fitness evaluation function.

We usually refer to the simple case, where only one subpopulation exists in the entire evolutionary algorithm.
